Impermanent Loss Estimation

For every pool:

impermanent_loss = 2 * sqrt(price_ratio) / (1+price_ratio) â€” 1

Where 

price_ratio = new_exchange_rate / exchange_rate_when_liquidity_was_added

Estimation Algorithm:

exchange_rate_when_liquidity_was_added = current exchage rate

new_exchage_rate should be forecasted 

The following formula can be used:

new_exchange_rate =  exchange_rate_when_liquidity_was_added + standard_deviation_of_the_exchange_rate
