0) Connect to Watson and launch ganache-cli
1) Identify which contract emits an event needed 
2) Find contracts address on etherscan
3) Copy its abi code and put it into .abi file in the program's directory
4) Run abigen --abi=./build/filename.abi --pkg=store --out=filename.go
5) in main:
client, err := ethclient.Dial("http://localhost:8888")
to connect to blockchain
var contractAddress = common.HexToAddress("0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D") // paste in contract address
depending on the golang code generated by the abigen create a new instance of the contract, it will look something like this:
uniswap, err := uniswapRouter2.NewUniswapRouter2(contractAddress, client)
