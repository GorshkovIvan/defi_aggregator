NEXT STEPS:
Fix Uniswap downloader for historical volumes
Finish future volume estimator function
Implement calculateROI properly
Add not investment advice disclaimer
User input validation for front end
Historical Trading volume data (ex Uniswap)		- need for accurate ROI
Get Reward Mechanism			- need to figure out what it is for pools other than Uniswap
Connect Database
Add refresh button on front end

OptimisePortfolio 			- need to implement algo. Step 1 - create token pair permutations
Curve data pulling implementation 
Get gas fees
Version of OptimisePortfolio with swaps


HOW TO COMPILE
move everything from ui into main folder - in Defi Aggregator
run 'npm run build' from cmd
compile running-results-table into an executable
set GOOS=linux 
go build
upload everything to cpanel - 
on namecheap console, run: PORT=1234 ./running-results-table


COMPLETE
UI + populate risk from UI		- bring to match our report 1
JS + Golang Tests			- complete?
isHistDataAlreadyDownloaded 		- done (Check for dates can add later)
calculatehistoricalvolatility 		- Need to check if gives right output
NewHistoricalCurrencyDataFromRaw 	- done
retrieveDataForTokensFromDatabase 	- done
Aave data pulling implementation	- check to confirm j loop in tokenqueue is 1 element
Create risk var in database				- done 
WETH Data not downloading correctly 	- done
Why runs 3x?							- done


TO BUILD AND RUN
move everything from ui into main folder (cut + paste all contents of UI into main running-results-table directory)
compile react app with 'npm run build' from cmd
set GOOS=linux - to compile the golang for web server
go build - to compile running-results-table into a linux executable
Upload both the contents of build folder (it is created by npm build) and the go executable to cpanel
run from terminal on cpanel: PORT=1234 ./running-results-table
